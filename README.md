The HAL 900
Smart Programmable Power Sockets

Tied to web interface for programming and outputting an app for your mobile phone or tablet. 

All our sockets basically have three states:  
1. Always ON, refrigerator.
2. ON or OFF, depending on if I'm home or not.
3. Time based, coffee machine lap top charger.

We usually have several devise connected to our multi sockets, but
these devises usually don't have to be on at the same time. One example is charging your laptop over night while the monitor can be switched off.

To solve theses kind of conflicts I purpose a programmable multi power sockets (can be one or several sockets) where each socket have their own unique ID and its state can be turned ON, OFF or set on a timer. 

The set up is done through a user friendly, personalized web page that also links in to an mobile app for controlling or modifying your setup.

To take this a step further we could add pre-programmed mood states, eg. at 10 PM the lights goes dimmer, reminding you to shut down your computer or TV and start your evening routine. In the morning you could have the lights slowly fade up similar to Phillips wake up light, you could even set it up so you wake up to the smell of coffee or freshly baked croissants that you put in the oven the night before. 

Now that is the way to start a day!
